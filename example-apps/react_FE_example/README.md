# CleanIAM React Frontend Example

This directory serves as a reference to the comprehensive React implementation found in the CleanIAM Management Portal.

## Management Portal as a Reference Implementation

Rather than providing a simplified example, we recommend examining the full-featured CleanIAM Management Portal repository, which serves as a production-quality reference implementation of React + CleanIAM integration.

The Management Portal demonstrates:

- **Complete OIDC Flow**: Authentication code flow with PKCE
- **Role-based Authorization**: Fine-grained access control
- **Token Management**: Secure token handling with automatic refresh
- **API Integration**: Type-safe API client generation
- **Modern React Patterns**: Hooks, context, and best practices
